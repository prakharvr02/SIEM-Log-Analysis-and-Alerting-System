# SIEM Log Analysis and Alerting System

This project is a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Log Analysis and Alerting System designed to collect, process, and analyze logs from various sources, detect potential security incidents, and send real-time alerts. The system uses **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for log aggregation and **Python** for custom log analysis and alerting functionalities. Alerts are sent via **email** and **Slack** when suspicious activity is detected.

### Key Features:

- **Log Collection:** Collects logs from servers, firewalls, and network devices.
- **Log Analysis:** Real-time analysis of logs for security threats.
- **Alerting:** Sends email and Slack notifications for suspicious activities.
- **Visualization:** Dashboards to view and analyze log data using Kibana.
- **Scalability:** Designed to scale for enterprise environments.

### Technologies Used:

- **Backend:** Python, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Alerting:** Email (smtplib), Slack Webhooks
- **Visualization:** Kibana Dashboards

### Setup Instructions:

The entire setup process, including installation of Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Python dependencies, and configuration, is documented in the `homelab.md` file.

Please refer to `homelab.md` for detailed setup steps and configurations.
